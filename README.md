# Excel_Projects-Data_Analytics

## üìä Data Analytics Portfolio by Piotr Stelmaszczyk

This repository contains my projects, focusing on data analysis and dashboarding using MS Excel.

As an aspiring data analyst I created this portfolio to demonstrate my skills in:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Data analysis and visualisation
- Interactive dashboards
- Excel functions, pivot tables, charts, power query, dax, power pivot

Both projects were developed as part of an Excel course for aspiring data analysts. The datasets used in these projects were originally collected using a Python web scraper created by the course author - Luke Barousse. The scraper pulled real-world job postings for data-related roles from popular online job-seeking platfroms.
